## Introduction

This website was created on behalf of my client, a complementary therpaist and midwife based in Birmingham.
It was the first website I created in january 2023 after starting to learn HTML and CSS in September of 2022.

As well as the code, I also designed the brand identity, logo and all of the graphics and also helped to write the copy!

Since creating this website, I have learned so much about frameworks, libraries, packages, etc. and if I were to build it today, I would no doubt do things very differently. However, the website is efficient, isn't overly engineered and is easily modified so I think it serves it's purpose well.

## Installation

To work with this website, follow these steps:

1. Start a new project in your IDE.
2. Clone down the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/dannykryan/rise-therapies.git
```

3. You can now view the website running locally by right-clicking index.html and choosing 'Open with Live Server'.
