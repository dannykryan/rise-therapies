                    <p>As a trained and insured midwife, I can give you a unique and specialised service to treat any issues you may have from first trimester and until the first couple of months after birth. Regular massage, reflexology and aromatherapy have been proven to be beneficial and reduce the need for medical treatment or hospital admission.</p>
                    <p>My experience has taught me that everyone’s needs are different, so my treatment sessions are always individually designed to meet your specific needs. All initial appointments will include a telephone or email consultation at no extra cost to assess your personal needs, suitability and to recommend a bespoke treatment plan.</p>
                    <p>Using one individual therapy or a combination, an hour hands on treatment is priced from £85 per session. Available treatments include (but are not limited to):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Aromatherapy</li>
                        <li>Reflexology (reflex zone therapy)</li>
                        <li>Structural Reflex Zone Therapy</li>
                        <li>Acupressure</li>

                    <p>Also available is an <strong>Aromatherapy Blending Service</strong></strong> (£25) for those who have already had an initial aromatherapy treatment. It includes an evaluation of previous treatment, assessment of symptoms and a bespoke aromatherapy blend for you to use at home.</p>

This series of three 2.5-hour long treatments will combine a variety of complementary therapies including acupressure, reflexology, structural reflex zone therapy, aromatherapy and massage to help alleviate the physiological discomforts that often come with pregnancy.</p>

This series of three 2.5-hour long treatments will use a combination of techniques including acupressure, reflexology, aromatherapy, and massage to treat any specific ailments such as back pain, SPD, hemorrhoids, insomnia, and tiredness.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the therapies, I, a midwife, will also provide you with time to talk. My aim is to empower you to make the best choices for you and your baby, and ensure a positive birthing experience. I will also provide birth planning and one-to-one birth preparation to help you feel in control and confident going into labor. We will discuss pain relief options, and what to expect the day of and after a caesarean section and how to care for your newborn.</p>
                    <p>At each appointment after an assessment of symptoms, you will receive an aromatherapy oil blended bespoke for you to take home and continue treatment.</p>

                        <p>If you have gone past your due date, my Post-Date Package aims to encourage the natural onset of labor and avoid the need for a medical induction. These three 2.5-hour long treatments will use a combination of techniques including acupressure, reflexology, structural reflex zone therapy, aromatherapy, and massage to make you feel relaxed, calm, and release endorphins and oxytocin, while reducing the stress hormones cortisol and adrenaline.</p>
                        <p>These techniques are safe for you and your baby and aim to initiate or enhance contractions, promote cervical dilation, and aid decent of the fetus into the pelvis. The advantages are if labor does not commence, midwives report a more favorable cervix and increased chance of experiencing minimal intervention.</p>
                        <p>During the appointments, we will teach you and your birth partner how to stimulate acupressure points so that you can continue this treatment at home. You will also receive an aromatherapy oil blend of uterotonic oils (nature’s syntocinon) to take home and continue treatment.</p>
