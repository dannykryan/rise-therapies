                    <p><strong>90 minute appointment that includes 60 minutes of hands-on treatment.</strong></p>
                    <p>As a trained and insured midwife, I can give you a unique and specialised service to treat any issues you may have from first trimester and until the first couple of months after birth. Regular massage, reflexology and aromatherapy have been proven to be beneficial and reduce the need for medical treatment or hospital admission.</p>
                    <p>My experience has taught me that everyone’s needs are different, so my treatment sessions are always individually designed to meet your specific needs. All initial appointments will include a telephone or email consultation at no extra cost to assess your personal needs, suitability and to recommend a bespoke treatment plan.</p>
                    <p>Using one individual therapy or a combination, an hour-long, hands-on treatment is priced from £85 per session. Available treatments include (but are not limited to):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Aromatherapy</li>
                        <li>Reflexology (reflex zone therapy)</li>
                        <li>Structural Reflex Zone Therapy</li>
                        <li>Acupressure</li>
                        <li>Massage</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In each single treatment session, I will create for you a <strong>custom aromatherapy oil blend</strong> (available separately for £20) for you to take home either for treatment of symptoms or just for relaxation.</p>

                <p><strong>Three tailored treatment sessions to help ease the discomforts of pregnancy.</strong></p>
                <p>I understand that every pregnancy is unique, and that's why I offer a personalized therapy package tailored to your specific needs. Each 90 minute long appointment includes 60 minutes of hands-on treatment and will combine a variety of complementary therapies including acupressure, reflexology, structural reflex zone therapy, aromatherapy and massage to help alleviate the physiological discomforts that often come with pregnancy.</p>
                <p>During each appointment, we will work together to assess your symptoms and develop a bespoke treatment plan that leverages your body's natural healing capacity to adapt to the changes it's going through. You will also receive a personalized aromatherapy oil blend that you can take home to continue your treatment between appointments.</p>

                <br>
                    <h3 class="treatment-header">Birth-Preparation Package - £375</h3>
                    <p><strong>Three tailored treatment sessions to prepare you for giving birth.</strong></p>
                    <p>After almost 9 months of carrying for your baby, it's time to pamper yourself and reduce stress with my Birth-Preparation Package. Each 90 minute long appointment includes 60 minutes of hands-on treatment and will use a combination of techniques including acupressure, reflexology, aromatherapy, and massage to treat any specific ailments such as back pain, SPD, hemorrhoids, insomnia, and tiredness.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the therapies, I, a midwife, will also provide you with time to talk. My aim is to empower you to make the best choices for you and your baby, and ensure a positive birthing experience. I will also provide birth planning and one-to-one birth preparation to help you feel in control and confident going into labor. We will discuss pain relief options, and what to expect the day of and after a caesarean section and how to care for your newborn.</p>
                    <p>At each appointment after an assessment of symptoms, you will receive an aromatherapy oil blended bespoke for you to take home and continue treatment.</p>
                <br>
                    <h3 class="treatment-header">Post-Date Package - £250</h3>
                    <p><strong>Three tailored treatment sessions designed to help you avoid medical induction and induce labour naturally.</strong></p>
                        <p>If you have gone past your due date, my Post-Date Package aims to encourage the natural onset of labor and avoid the need for a medical induction. Each 90 minute long appointment includes 60 minutes of hands-on treatment and will use a combination of techniques including acupressure, reflexology, structural reflex zone therapy, aromatherapy, and massage to make you feel relaxed, calm, and release endorphins and oxytocin, while reducing the stress hormones cortisol and adrenaline.</p>
                        <p>These techniques are safe for you and your baby and aim to initiate or enhance contractions, promote cervical dilation, and aid decent of the fetus into the pelvis. The advantages are if labor does not commence, midwives report a more favorable cervix and increased chance of experiencing minimal intervention.</p>
                        <p>During the appointments, we will teach you and your birth partner how to stimulate acupressure points so that you can continue this treatment at home. You will also receive an aromatherapy oil blend of uterotonic oils (nature’s syntocinon) to take home and continue treatment.</p>
