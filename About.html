                <p>I am a registered midwife and mother to two beautiful boys. I work as an independent specialist
                    midwife therapist and as an NHS birth centre midwife. I am passionate about promoting a positive
                    pregnancy experience through a holistic approach, nurturing mind, body, and soul. Stimulating the
                    mind through education to empower informed decision-making, nourishing the body with a
                    combination of complimentary therapies tailored to the individual and changing needs and
                    nourishing the soul with time to talk, reflect and discuss concerns and offer practical, realistic, and
                    balanced advice. I seek to provide women and their families holistic, compassionate care catered to
                    each family’s unique needs and desires.</p>
                    <p>At each appointment I use a combination of complementary therapies designed to treat your
                        individual and changing symptoms and reduce the effects of common problems experienced at
                        different stages of pregnancy. I want you to feel cared for and pampered, nurtured and empowered
                        throughout your pregnancy and postnatal period, with a focus on improving your health and
                        wellbeing, treating you holistically and ensuring you have a positive experience without the time
                        restraints and the limited resources of conventional care. You will have time to discuss any
                        pregnancy related symptoms or concerns you may be experiencing and be offered a combination of
                        complimentary therapies at each appointment; this therapeutic clinical intervention will trigger the
                        body’s own healing capacity and help the body adjust to the changes of pregnancy.</p>

                        <p>There is a huge demand for complimentary therapies in pregnancy, estimated over 80% of pregnant
                            women use complimentary therapies for relaxation and stress relief. Increasingly women are seeking
                            natural ways of dealing with specific issues such as sickness, backache, and avoiding induction of
                            labour. Women want some ‘me time’ and a ‘listening ear’ seeking services that give an aspect of care
                            often not provided by an overstretched NHS. I undertook additional training in complimentary
                            therapies with Denise Tiran of Expectancy. Denise pioneered complimentary therapies as a specialist
                            field within midwifery education and practice in the early 1980s and is acknowledged as one of the
                            leading authorities in the field.</p>
                            <p>One of the many reasons I became a midwife was for job satisfaction, I want to end each day proud
                                of the service I deliver, honouring the women I work with by providing them with a uniquely holistic
                                approach. Midwife means ‘with woman’ and I want a fulfilling and empowering experience for
                                myself and the women I have the privilege to share this incredible journey with, I will offer a calm
                                and reassuring presence in which to build a trusting relationship, whether I see you for a one-off
                                relaxation treatment or care for you throughout the entirety of your journey with our bespoke
                                therapies and private midwife package.</p>
